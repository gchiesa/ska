# USE CASE: Multiple Template Subfolders

This guide explains how to use SKA when a remote repository hosts multiple templates in subfolders (for example, one
repo acting as a catalog of templates).

## When to use this

- Your organization keeps many templates in a single repository, each under its own folder.
- You want to scaffold from a specific subfolder path and optionally pin a branch or tag.

## Blueprint URL format for subfolders

You can reference a subfolder inside a remote Git repository by including the path after the repository name and before
the optional ref:

- https://github.com/ORG/REPO//path/to/template@ref
- https://gitlab.com/ORG/REPO//path/to/template@ref

> [!NOTE]
> - The ref after the @ can be a branch (e.g., @main), a tag (e.g., @v1.2.3), or omitted to use the default branch.
> - Both URL forms are supported. Use the one you prefer.

## Example repository layout

Suppose your template catalog looks like this:

```
templates-repo/templates/
    service-rest/
    service-grpc/
    library-utility/
    common/
    fragments/
```

Each folder under templates/ is a separate blueprint you can target.

## Create from a subfolder template

Scaffold a new project by pointing --blueprint to the subfolder:

- Using an HTTPS URL:
  ```sh
  ska create \
    --blueprint https://github.com/your-org/templates-repo/templates/service-rest@v1.2.0 \
    --output ./my-rest-service
  ```

What happens:

- SKA downloads only what it needs from the repo.
- It loads the template from the specified subfolder.
- If the template defines inputs, SKA will show the interactive form (unless you use --non-interactive).

## Pinning and updating

- Pin a known-good template version with a tag: @v1.2.0
- Use a branch for fast iteration: @main or @develop
- Omit @ to use the repositoryâ€™s default branch

After creation, your project contains a .ska-config/ folder that stores the upstream reference. To bring in updates from
the same upstream path and ref:
